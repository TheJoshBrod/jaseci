---

### 9. context_managers.jac

---

### 10. atom.jac (Additional Issues)

**Coverage:** See above, but file structure is confusing

**Issues:**
- File mixes multiple concerns (impl for enum x, global declarations, entry block)
- Contains forward reference to undefined `enum x` which is implemented via `impl x`
- Hard to validate as a pure "atom" demonstration

**Recommendation:** Restructure file to focus exclusively on atomic expressions and literals. Move enum implementation to appropriate section.

---

### 11. object_spatial_walker_statements.jac

**Coverage:** 100% but minimal

**Note:** This file is extremely minimal (only demonstrates disengage). The grammar section "Object spatial Walker statements" includes both visit_stmt and disengage_stmt, but visit is covered extensively in visit_statements.jac.

**Recommendation:** Rename file or expand to include visit examples, or merge with visit_statements.jac and disengage_statements.jac.

---

### 12. codeblocks_and_statements.jac (Revisited)

**Additional Note:** This file intentionally provides minimal coverage as it serves as an introductory example. All missing statement types are thoroughly covered in dedicated files. This is acceptable as long as the documentation makes this clear.

---

## Most Common Missing Features

Based on the analysis, the following features are most commonly missing or incomplete across files:

### 1. Async Features (3 files)

- Async comprehensions (collection_values.jac)

### 2. Advanced Function Parameters (1 file)

- Keyword-only separator `*` (functions_and_abilities.jac)

### 3. Pattern Matching (1 file)
- Or patterns with `|` operator (match_patterns.jac)
- As patterns with `as` keyword (match_patterns.jac)

### 4. Type References (1 file)

## Conclusion

The Jac reference examples provide **excellent coverage** of the grammar specification, with an overall average of **94.2%** coverage across all files. The majority of gaps are in advanced or less commonly used features such as:

- Async variants (for, with, comprehensions)
- Advanced function parameter separators (/, *)
- Pattern matching or/as patterns
- Matrix multiplication operator
- Type reference backtick operator

These gaps are relatively minor and can be addressed with targeted additions to 8-10 files. The reference examples successfully demonstrate all core language features and provide strong foundation for users learning Jac.

### Strengths
- Comprehensive coverage of core features
- Well-organized by grammar section
- Good use of comments to explain features
- Demonstrates both basic and advanced usage patterns

### Areas for Improvement
- Add missing async examples
- Include advanced function parameter patterns
- Expand pattern matching examples
- Better cross-referencing between related files
- Add grammar rule mapping in comments
