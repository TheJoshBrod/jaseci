- **Session Node**: Maintains persistent memory state across interactions
- **Update Walker**: Handles user interactions and memory updates

```jac
obj Response {
    has follow_up_questions: str;    # Next question to ask
    has summary: str;                # Concise memory summary
    has when: str;                   # Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    has who: List[str];              # Names of people involved
    has what: str;                   # What the memory is about
    has where: List[str];            # Relevant locations
    has terminate_conversation: bool; # Completion flag
    has show_summary: bool;          # Display summary flag
}
```

## <span style="color: orange">Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install jac-streamlit requests jaclang jac-cloud byllm
   ```

2. Start the Jac Cloud server:
   ```bash
   jac serve friendzone_lite.jac
   ```

3. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   jac streamlit frontend.jac
   ```

## <span style="color: orange">Usage Workflow

### <span style="color: orange">Step 1: Image Upload
- Provide an image URL of a photo containing a memory you want to capture
- The system supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Images can be from social media, cloud storage, or any accessible web location

### <span style="color: orange">Step 2: Initial Analysis
The AI will:
- Analyze the visual content of your image
- Identify key elements like people, places, and activities
- Generate an initial memory framework
- Ask the first targeted question to gather more details

### <span style="color: orange">Step 3: Conversational Refinement
Engage in a natural conversation where the AI will:
- Ask specific questions about missing details
- Focus on one aspect at a time (when, who, where, what)
- Build upon your previous answers
- Gradually complete the memory profile

### <span style="color: orange">Step 4: Memory Completion
When sufficient details are gathered:
- The AI will indicate the conversation is complete
- A comprehensive summary will be generated
- All memory details will be structured and stored

## <span style="color: orange">Example Memory Capture Session

### <span style="color: orange">Initial Image Analysis
**User uploads:** Beach vacation photo with friends

**AI Initial Response:**
"I can see this appears to be a beach scene with several people. To help me capture this memory completely, when was this photo taken?"

### <span style="color: orange">Conversational Flow
**User:** "This was taken last summer, around July 2024"

**AI:** "Great! I can see there are several people in the photo. Can you tell me who these people are?"

**User:** "That's me with my college friends Sarah and Mike"

**AI:** "Wonderful! Where was this beach vacation? Which beach or location was this at?"

**User:** "This was at Santa Monica Beach in California"

**AI:** "Perfect! What was the occasion or what were you doing during this beach visit?"

**User:** "We were celebrating Sarah's birthday with a beach day trip"

### <span style="color: orange">Final Summary
**Generated Memory:**

- **When:** 2024-07-15
- **Who:** User, Sarah, Mike
- **Where:** Santa Monica Beach, California
- **What:** Beach day celebration for Sarah's birthday
