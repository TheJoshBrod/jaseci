# Build an AI-Powered Multimodal MCP Chatbot

This step-by-step guide will walk you through building a modern chatbot that can chat with your documents, images, and videos. By the end, you'll have a working multimodal AI assistant and understand how to use Jac's unique programming features to build intelligent applications.

## What You'll Build

You'll create a chatbot that can:

- Upload and chat with PDFs, text files, images, and videos
- Search your documents and provide context-aware answers
- Answer general questions using web search
- Understand and discuss images and videos using AI vision
- Route different types of questions to specialized AI handlers


## What You'll Learn

- **Object Spatial Programming**: Use Jac's node-walker architecture to organize your application
- **Mean Typed Programming (MTP)**: Let AI classify and route user queries automatically with just simple definitions
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Build modular, reusable AI tools
- **Multimodal AI**: Work with text, images, and videos in one application

## Technologies We'll Use

- **Jac Language**: For the main application logic
- **Jac Cloud**: Backend server infrastructure
- **Streamlit**: User-friendly web interface
- **ChromaDB**: Document search and storage
- **OpenAI GPT**: AI chat and vision capabilities
- **Serper API**: Real-time web search

## Project Structure

We'll create six main files:

- `client.jac`: The web interface for chat and file uploads
- `server.jac`: The main application using Object Spatial Programming
- `server.impl.jac`: Implementation details and function bodies for `server.jac` (automatically imported by Jac)
- `mcp_server.jac`: Tool server for document search and web search
- `mcp_client.jac`: Interface to communicate with tools
- `tools.jac`: Document processing and search logic

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, install the required packages. We recommend Python 3.12 or newer:

```bash
pip install jaclang jac-cloud jac-streamlit byllm langchain langchain-community langchain-openai langchain-chroma chromadb openai pypdf tiktoken requests mcp[cli] anyio
```

Next, get your API keys. You'll need an OpenAI API key for the AI features. For web search, get a free API key from [Serper](https://serper.dev/).

Set your environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>
export SERPER_API_KEY=<your-serper-key>
```

If you see no errors, you're ready to start building!

## Step 2: Understanding the Architecture

Your application uses Jac's Object Spatial Programming to create a clean, modular design:

**Nodes** represent different parts of your system (Router, Chat types, Sessions). Each node has specific responsibilities and capabilities.

**Walkers** move through your node network, carrying information and executing logic. They represent the actions your system can perform.

**Mean Typed Programming (MTP)** lets AI automatically classify and route requests, making your application intelligent without complex rule-based logic.

**Implementation Separation**: The `server.jac` file contains the high-level structure and logic, while `server.impl.jac` provides the detailed function implementations. Jac seamlessly imports the implementation file, allowing for clean separation of concerns.

The application consists of:

- **Document Processing Engine** (`tools.jac`): Processes and searches documents using vector embeddings
- **Tool Server** (`mcp_server.jac`): Exposes document and web search as MCP tools
- **Tool Client** (`mcp_client.jac`): Interfaces with the tool server
- **Main Application** (`server.jac` + `server.impl.jac`): Routes queries and manages conversations
- **Web Interface** (`client.jac`): User-friendly Streamlit interface

## Step 3: Run Your Application

Now let's see your creation in action! You'll need three terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Start the tool server:**
```bash
jac run mcp_server.jac
```

**Terminal 2 - Start the main application:**
```bash
jac serve server.jac
```

**Terminal 3 - Launch the web interface:**
```bash
jac streamlit client.jac
```

If everything starts successfully, open your browser and go to the Streamlit URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

## Step 4: Test Your Chatbot

1. **Register and log in** using the web interface
2. **Upload some files**: Try PDFs, text files, images, or videos
3. **Start chatting**: Ask questions about your uploaded content or general questions

The system will automatically route your questions:

- Document questions go to the RAG system
- General questions use web search
- Image questions use vision AI
- Video questions analyze video content

## What You've Accomplished

Congratulations! You've built a sophisticated AI application that demonstrates several advanced concepts:

- **Multimodal AI capabilities** that work with text, images, and videos
- **Intelligent routing** using AI-based classification
- **Modular architecture** with reusable tools via MCP
- **Clean separation of concerns** using Object Spatial Programming
- **Real-time web search integration**
- **Efficient document search** with vector embeddings

## Extending Your Chatbot

Your chatbot is designed to be extensible. You could add:

- **New file types**: Support for audio files, spreadsheets, or presentations
- **Additional tools**: Weather APIs, database connections, or custom business logic
- **Enhanced AI models**: Different LLMs for specialized tasks
- **Advanced search**: Hybrid search combining keyword and semantic search
- **Custom chat nodes**: Specialized handlers for domain-specific questions

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

- **Dependencies**: Make sure all packages are installed and compatible with your Python version
- **Server startup**: Start the MCP server before the main server
- **File uploads**: Check server logs if uploads fail, and verify supported file types
- **API keys**: Verify your OpenAI and Serper API keys are set correctly
- **Ports**: Ensure all three services are running on their respective ports

## API Reference

Your application exposes these main endpoints:

- `POST /user/register` — Create a new user account
- `POST /user/login` — Login and get an access token
- `POST /walker/upload_file` — Upload files (requires authentication)
- `POST /walker/interact` — Chat with the AI (requires authentication)
