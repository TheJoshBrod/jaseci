# <span style="color: orange">Tutorial: Building an AI-Powered RPG Level Generator

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll build a dynamic RPG level generator using LLMs and Jaclangâ€™s `by llm` syntax. The tutorial covers creating a system that uses AI to generate balanced, progressively challenging game levels.

The system creates game levels automatically through structured data types for spatial positioning and game elements, progressive difficulty scaling that adapts to player progress, and dynamic map rendering from AI-generated data.

Youâ€™ll write code, test it, and see AI-generated levels come to life.

<!-- ## <span style="color: orange">Overview

This tutorial covers building an AI-driven RPG level generator using Jaclang's `by llm` syntax. The system creates game levels automatically through structured data types for spatial positioning and game elements, progressive difficulty scaling that adapts to player progress, and dynamic map rendering from AI-generated data. -->

## <span style="color: orange">Prerequisites

Required dependencies:

```bash
pip install byllm
```

OpenAI API key configuration:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

- Basic knowledge of [Jaclang syntax](/jac_book/)
- Familiarity with game development concepts (optional)

## <span style="color: orange">Implementation Steps

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Define Game Data Structures** - Create the building blocks for the game world
2. **Implement AI-Powered Methods** - Use `by llm` to delegate level creation to AI
3. **Build the Level Manager** - Coordinate the generation process
4. **Test and Iterate** - Run the system and validate AI-generated levels

## <span style="color: orange">Step 1: Define Game Data Structures

**What weâ€™re going to do:**

Weâ€™ll set up the core data structures for the game world: positions, walls, levels, and maps. These serve as a vocabulary that the AI uses to understand and generate game content.

### <span style="color: orange">Basic Position and Wall Objects

Create a new file called `level_manager.jac` and start by writing the foundational objects:

```jac linenums="1"
obj Position {
    has x: int, y: int;     # 2D coordinate

}

obj Wall {
    has start_pos: Position, end_pos: Position;       # wall starts and ends here
}
```

- `Position` (Lines 1-2) defines a point in 2D space. `Wall` (Lines 6-7) uses two positions (`start_pos` and  `end_pos`) to define a barrier.

### <span style="color: orange">Game Configuration Objects

Next, define the main game configuration:

```jac linenums="9"
obj Level {
    has name: str, difficulty: int;     # difficulty scaling
    has width: int, height: int, num_wall: int; # spatial constraints
    has num_enemies: int; time_countdown: int;  # enemies + time
    n_retries_allowed: int;     # retries allowed
}

obj Map {
    has level: Level, walls: list[Wall];    # embeds Level + walls
    has small_obstacles: list[Position];    # extra blocks
    has enemies: list[Position];    # enemy positions
    has player_pos: Position;       # player start
}
```

- `Level` (Lines 9-13) describes rules. `Map` (Lines 16-20) describes actual placement of objects.

## <span style="color: orange">Step 2: Implement AI-Powered Generation Methods

**What weâ€™re going to do:**
Weâ€™ll connect to an LLM (GPT-4o here) and define AI-powered methods for generating new levels and maps.

At the top of `level_manager.jac`, import the model:

```jac
import from byllm.lib { Model }

glob llm = Model(model_name="gpt-4o", verbose=True);
```

- `glob llm` sets up GPT-4o as our generator, with `verbose=True` so we can see detailed outputs.

Now define the `LevelManager` object:

```jac linenums="22"
obj LevelManager {
    has current_level: int = 0, current_difficulty: int = 1,
        prev_levels: list[Level] = [], prev_level_maps: list[Map] = [];

    def create_next_level (last_levels: list[Level], difficulty: int, level_width: int, level_height: int)
    -> Level by llm();

    def create_next_map(level: Level) -> Map by llm();
}
```

- The key parts are **Lines 26 and 29**: the `by llm` keyword makes the AI responsible for generating `Level` and `Map` objects.

- For `create_next_level()` (Line 26), we pass these arguments to retuen a complete level as the output:
    - Historical Context: last_levels ensures variety
    - Difficulty Guidance: difficulty scales challenge
    - Spatial Constraints: level_width, level_height

- For `create_next_map()` (Line 29) we return a detailed map as the output by:
    - Taking a high-level `Level`
    - Generating specific positions for walls, enemies, and player
    - Producing a balanced, playable layout

<!-- ### <span style="color: orange">AI Method Implementation

The `by llm` methods work as follows:

**Level Creation Method**
```jac
def create_next_level (last_levels: list[Level], difficulty: int, level_width: int, level_height: int)
-> Level by llm();
```

**Method parameters:**
- **Historical Context**: `last_levels` - Previous levels for ensuring variety
- **Difficulty Guidance**: `difficulty` - Scale the challenge appropriately
- **Spatial Constraints**: `level_width, level_height` - Boundary parameters
- **Expected Output**: Return a complete `Level` object

**Map Generation Method**
```jac
def create_next_map(level: Level) -> Map by llm();
```

**Method function:**

- Takes a high-level `Level` configuration
- Generates specific positions for walls, enemies, and the player
- Creates a balanced, playable layout
- Returns a detailed `Map` object -->

??? note "AI Data Structure Understanding"
    The AI automatically understands data structures. When you pass a `Level` object, the AI knows about all its properties (difficulty, dimensions, enemy count, etc.) and uses this context to make intelligent decisions.

## <span style="color: orange">Step 3: Manage Level Flow

**What weâ€™re going to do:**
Weâ€™ll write logic to coordinate AI generation: keep track of past levels, scale difficulty, and return a new `Level` + `Map`.

Inside `LevelManager`, add:

```jac linenums="31"
def get_next_level -> tuple(Level, Map) {
    self.current_level += 1;

    # Keeping Only the Last 3 Levels
    if len(self.prev_levels) > 3 {
        self.prev_levels.pop(0);
        self.prev_level_maps.pop(0);
    }

    # Generating the New Level
    new_level = self.create_next_level(
        self.prev_levels,
        self.current_difficulty,
        20, 20
    );

    self.prev_levels.append(new_level);

    # Generating the Map of the New Level
    new_level_map = self.create_next_map(new_level);
    self.prev_level_maps.append(new_level_map);

    # Increasing the Difficulty for end of every 2 Levels
    if self.current_level % 2 == 0 {
        self.current_difficulty += 1;
    }

    return (new_level, new_level_map);
}
```

This method executes the following sequence:

1. **Level Counter**: Increments the level number
2. **Memory Management**: Keeps only the last 3 levels
3. **AI Level Generation**: Calls the AI to create a new level
4. **AI Map Generation**: Requests the AI to generate map
5. **Difficulty Progression**: Increases difficulty every 2 levels
6. **Return Results**: Returns both the level config and detailed map

Now letâ€™s add a visualization helper that converts maps into tile grids. Create a function that converts the AI-generated `Map` into game tiles:

```jac linenums="60"
def get_map(map: Map) -> str {
    map_tiles = [['.' for _ in range(map.level.width)] for _ in range(map.level.height)];

    # Place walls
    for wall in map.walls {
        for x in range(wall.start_pos.x, wall.end_pos.x + 1) {
            for y in range(wall.start_pos.y, wall.end_pos.y + 1) {
                map_tiles[y-1][x-1] = 'B';
            }
        }
    }

    # Place obstacles, enemies, and player
    for obs in map.small_obstacles {
        map_tiles[obs.y-1][obs.x-1] = 'B';
    }
    for enemy in map.enemies {
        map_tiles[enemy.y-1][enemy.x-1] = 'E';
    }
    map_tiles[map.player_pos.y-1][map.player_pos.x-1] = 'P';

    # Add border walls
    map_tiles = [['B'] + row + ['B'] for row in map_tiles];
    map_tiles = [['B' for _ in range(map.level.width + 2)]] + map_tiles + [['B' for _ in range(map.level.width + 2)]];
    return [''.join(row) for row in map_tiles];
}
```

**Now:**

- walls become `B`
- enemies become `E`
- player starts at `P`
- border walls wrap around the map


<!-- ### <span style="color: orange">Map Conversion Process

The conversion function executes these operations:

1. **Initialize Grid**: Creates a 2D array filled with '.' (empty space)
2. **Place Walls**: Converts `Wall` objects into 'B' (block) characters
3. **Add Obstacles**: Places small obstacles as additional 'B' characters
4. **Position Enemies**: Places 'E' characters at enemy positions
5. **Place Player**: Sets 'P' character at the player's starting position
6. **Add Borders**: Surrounds the entire map with walls for boundaries

**Game Symbols:**

- `.` = Empty space (walkable)
- `B` = Block/Wall (impassable)
- `E` = Enemy (dangerous)
- `P` = Player (starting position) -->

## <span style="color: orange">Step 4: Test the AI Level Generator

Weâ€™ll test the system by generating AI levels and printing their difficulty, enemies, and maps.

Create a new file called `test_generator.jac`:

```jac linenums="1"
import from level_manager { LevelManager }

with entry {
    level_manager = LevelManager();

    print("Generating 3 AI-powered levels...\n");

    for i in range(3) {
        level, map_obj = level_manager.get_next_level();
        visual_map = level_manager.get_map(map_obj);

        print(f"=== LEVEL {i+1} ===");
        print(f"Difficulty: {level.difficulty}");
        print(f"Enemies: {level.num_enemies}");
        print(f"Walls: {level.num_wall}");
        print("Map:");
        for row in visual_map {
            print(row);
        }
        print("\n");
    }
}
```

Run this script:
```bash
jac run test_generator.jac
```

Expected output (AI may vary):
```
=== LEVEL 1 ===
Difficulty: 1
Enemies: 2
Walls: 3
Map:
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
B..................B
B.....B............B
B..................B
B........E.........B
B..................B
B..........P.......B
B..................B
B.E................B
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
```
