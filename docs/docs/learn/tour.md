## Python Superset Philosophy: All of Python Plus More

Jac is a drop-in replacement for Python and supersets Python, much like Typescript supersets Javascript or C++ supersets C. It extends Python's semantics while maintaining full interoperability with the Python ecosystem, introducing cutting-edge abstractions designed to minimize complexity and embrace AI-forward development.

<div class="code-block">
```jac
import math;
import from random { uniform }

def calc_distance(x1: float, y1: float, x2: float, y2: float) -> float {
return math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2);
}

with entry { # Generate random points
(x1, y1) = (uniform(0, 10), uniform(0, 10));
(x2, y2) = (uniform(0, 10), uniform(0, 10));

    distance = calc_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2);
    area = math.pi * (distance / 2) ** 2;

    print("Distance:", round(distance, 2), ", Circle area:", round(area, 2));

}

```
</div>

This snippet natively imports Python packages `math` and `random` and runs identically to its Python counterpart. Jac targets Python bytecode, so all Python libraries work with Jac.


## Programming Abstractions for AI

Jac provides novel constructs for integrating LLMs into code. A function body can simply be replaced with a call to an LLM, removing the need for prompt engineering or extensive use of new libraries.

```jac
import from byllm { Model }
glob llm = Model(model_name="gpt-4o");

enum Personality {
    INTROVERT,
    EXTROVERT,
    AMBIVERT
}

def get_personality(name: str) -> Personality by llm();

with entry {
    name = "Albert Einstein";
    result = get_personality(name);
    print(f"{result} detected for {name}");
}
```

??? info "How To Run"
    1. Install the byLLM plugin by `pip install byllm`
    2. Get a free Gemini API key: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
    3. Save your Gemini API as an environment variable (`export GEMINI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxx"`).
    > **Note:** > > You can use OpenAI, Anthropic or other API services as well as host your own LLM using Ollama or Huggingface.
    4. Copy this code into `example.jac` file and run with `jac run example.jac`

??? example "Output"
    `   Introvert personality detected for Albert Einstein
    `

`by llm()` delegates execution to an LLM without any extra library code.


## Going Beyond OOP with Object Spatial Programming

Traditional OOP with python classes (`class` or Jac's dataclass-like `obj`) that expresses object hierarchy and behavior is fully supported in Jac. Additionally, Jac programmers can also express object relationships with node classes (`node`), edge classes (`edge`), and object interactions with walker classes (`walker`) for richer modeling of problems called Object-Spatial Programing (OSP). This approach can be used where needed and maps nicely to may categories of problems (which happen to include agentic workflows ;-))

Instances of node and edge classes allow for assembling objects in a graph structure to express semantic relationships between objects. This goes beyond only modeling objects in memory as a disconnected soup of instances. Walker classes enables to expression of objects interacting with each other through special methods called abilities.

In this example, nodes represent meaningful entities (like Libraries and Shelves), while walkers (borrower) traverse these node objects and process them.

```jac
node Library {
    has location: str;
    can search_shelves with borrower entry;
}

node Shelf {
    has category: str;
    can check_books with borrower entry;
}

node Book {
    has title: str;
    has available: bool;
}

walker borrower {
    has book_needed: str;
    can find_book with `root entry;
}

with entry {
    # Building the world is just linking nodes
    lib1 = root ++> Library("Central Library");
    lib2 = root ++> Library("Community Library");

    shelf1 = lib1 ++> Shelf("Fiction");
    shelf2 = lib1 ++> Shelf("Non-Fiction");
    shelf3 = lib2 ++> Shelf("Science");

    book1 = shelf1 ++> Book("1984", True);
    book2 = shelf1 ++> Book("Brave New World", False);
    book3 = shelf2 ++> Book("Sapiens", True);
    book4 = shelf3 ++> Book("A Brief History of Time", False);
    book5 = shelf3 ++> Book("The Selfish Gene", True);

    # Send Borrower walking
    borrower("1984") spawn root;
}

impl Library.search_shelves {
    visit [-->(`?Shelf)]; # No loops, just visit
}

impl Shelf.check_books {
    found_book = [self -->(`?Book)](
        ?title == visitor.book_needed, available == True
    );

    if (found_book) {
        print(f"Borrowed: {found_book}");
        print(f"From Shelf: {self.category}");
        disengage; # Stop traversal cleanly
    } else {
        print("Book not available in shelf", self.category);
    }
}

impl borrower.find_book {
    visit [-->(`?Library)];
}
```

This MTP example demonstrates how Jac seamlessly integrates LLMs with structured node-walker logic, enabling intelligent, context-aware agents with just a few lines of code.

## Zero to Infinite Scale without any Code Changes

Jac's cloud-native abstractions make persistence and user concepts part of the language so that simple programs can run unchanged locally or in the cloud. Much like every object instance has a self referencial `this` or `self` reference. Every instance of a Jac program invocation has a `root` node reference that is unique to every user and for which any ohter node or edge objeccts connected to `root` will persist across code invocations. Thats it. Using `root` to access presistant user state and data, Jac deployments can be scaled from local enviornments infinitely into to the cloud with no code changes..

```jac
node Post {
    has content: str;
    has author: str;
}

walker create_post {
    has content: str, author: str;

    can func_name with `root entry {
        new_post = Post(content=self.content, author=self.author);
        here ++> new_post;
        report {"id": new_post.id, "status": "posted"};
    }
}
```

## Better Organized and Well Typed Codebases

Jac focuses on type safety and readability. Type hints are required and the built-in typing system eliminates boilerplate imports. Code structure can be split across multiple files, allowing definitions and implementations to be organized separately while still being checked by Jac's native type system.

=== "tweet.jac"

    ```jac
    obj Tweet {
        has content: str, author: str, timestamp: str, likes: int = 0;

        def like() -> None;
        def unlike() -> None;
        def get_preview(max_length: int) -> str;
        def get_like_count() -> int;
    }
    ```

=== "tweet.impl.jac"

    ```jac
    impl Tweet.like() -> None {
        self.likes += 1;
    }

    impl Tweet.unlike() -> None {
        if self.likes > 0 {
            self.likes -= 1;
        }
    }

    impl Tweet.get_preview(max_length: int) -> str {
        return self.content[:max_length] + "..." if len(self.content) > max_length else self.content;
    }

    impl Tweet.get_like_count() -> int {
        return self.likes;
    }
    ```

    This shows how declarations and implementations can live in separate files for maintainable, typed codebases.
