Special comprehensions are unique Jac syntactic constructs that provide concise filtering and modification operations on collections of objects. These comprehensions are particularly powerful in Object-Spatial Programming contexts, where they enable declarative querying and manipulation of nodes retrieved through graph traversal.

**Grammar Rules**

```
filter_compr: LPAREN NULL_OK filter_compare_list RPAREN
            | LPAREN TYPE_OP NULL_OK typed_filter_compare_list RPAREN
assign_compr: LPAREN EQ kw_expr_list RPAREN

filter_compare_list: (filter_compare_list COMMA)? filter_compare_item
typed_filter_compare_list: expression (COLON filter_compare_list)?
filter_compare_item: named_ref cmp_op expression
```

Special comprehensions come in two forms: **filter comprehensions** (select objects matching conditions) and **assign comprehensions** (bulk modify object attributes).

**Basic Filter Comprehension**

Lines 46-47 demonstrate the fundamental syntax:
```
filtered = items(?x >= 10, y < 15);
```

**Filter comprehension syntax**: `collection(?condition1, condition2, ...)`

Components:
- `collection` - Any iterable (list, set, result of edge traversal)
- `?` - Filter operator indicating comprehension mode
- `conditions` - Comma-separated attribute comparisons
- Conditions reference object attributes directly without `self.` or object prefix

**Filter Semantics**:
1. For each object in the collection
2. Evaluate ALL conditions against that object's attributes
3. Include object in result only if ALL conditions are True (AND logic)
4. Return new filtered collection

Line 47 filters items where both `x >= 10` AND `y < 15` are true. All conditions must pass for inclusion.

**Single Condition Filter**

Line 50 shows filtering with one condition:
```
high_x = items(?x > 15);
```

Single-condition filters are common for simple predicates. The `?` operator is still required even with one condition.

**Multiple Conditions (AND Logic)**

Line 54 demonstrates multi-condition filtering:
```
complex_filter = items(?x >= 5, x <= 15, y > 10);
```

Conditions:
- `x >= 5` - Lower bound on x
- `x <= 15` - Upper bound on x
- `y > 10` - Constraint on y

Object is included only if ALL three conditions are satisfied. This implements conjunction (AND) - there is no built-in OR syntax in filter comprehensions. For OR logic, use multiple filter calls or Python's `|` on results.

**Comparison Operators in Filters**

Lines 158-166 demonstrate all available comparison operators:

| Operator | Syntax | Example | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Equal | `==` | `(?x == 5)` | Attribute equals value |
| Not equal | `!=` | `(?x != 5)` | Attribute not equals value |
| Greater than | `>` | `(?x > 5)` | Attribute greater than value |
| Greater or equal | `>=` | `(?x >= 5)` | Attribute greater than or equal |
| Less than | `<` | `(?x < 5)` | Attribute less than value |
| Less or equal | `<=` | `(?x <= 5)` | Attribute less than or equal |

All standard Python comparison operators are supported. Complex expressions beyond simple comparisons may not be supported.

**Basic Assign Comprehension**

Lines 64-65 demonstrate attribute assignment:
```
objs(=y=100, z=200);
```

**Assign comprehension syntax**: `collection(=attr1=val1, attr2=val2, ...)`

Components:
- `collection` - Iterable of objects to modify
- `=` prefix - Indicates assign comprehension
- `attr=value` pairs - Attribute assignments, comma-separated
- Each object in collection has these attributes set to specified values

**Assign Semantics**:
1. For each object in the collection
2. Set each specified attribute to its value
3. Mutations occur in-place on original objects
4. Return the collection (containing now-modified objects)

Line 65 shows this is a mutating operation - original objects are changed, not copies.

**Chained Filter and Assign**

Line 76 demonstrates composition:
```
people(?age >= 30)(=score=95);
```

Chaining semantics:
1. Filter comprehension executes first: `people(?age >= 30)`
2. Returns filtered subset (people with age >= 30)
3. Assign comprehension executes on filtered result: `(=score=95)`
4. Only filtered objects are modified

This is powerful for selective bulk updates: "find all X matching condition, then update them". Lines 78-80 show the results - only Bob and Charlie (age >= 30) had scores updated to 95, while Alice (age=25) kept original score of 80.

**Multiple Chained Filters**

Line 85 shows sequential filtering:
```
result = data(?x > 2)(?y < 15)(?z >= 6);
```

Each filter narrows the result:
1. `data(?x > 2)` - First filter, reduces to items with x > 2
2. `(?y < 15)` - Applied to previous result, further reduces to items with y < 15
3. `(?z >= 6)` - Final filter on remaining items

Order matters - each filter receives output of previous filter. Functionally equivalent to single filter with all conditions, but can be more readable for complex logic or when conditions are computed dynamically.

**Filter Comprehensions on Edge Traversal Results**

Lines 115-117 demonstrate the CRITICAL spatial programming use case:
```
all_reports = [-->];
high_paid = all_reports(?salary > 75000);
```

**This is where comprehensions become essential for OSP**:
- `[-->]` traverses outgoing edges, returns target nodes
- Result is a collection of nodes (Employee objects in this case)
- Filter comprehension `(?salary > 75000)` filters nodes by attribute
- Enables declarative spatial queries: "get nodes via edges, filter by property"

This pattern appears throughout spatial programming:
1. Traverse graph to get candidate nodes
2. Filter nodes by attributes
3. Process filtered subset

**Typed Edge Traversal with Filtering**

Lines 121-123 show typed edges with filters:
```
reports_via_edge = [->:ReportsTo:->];
engineering = reports_via_edge(?department == "Engineering");
```

Workflow:
- `[->:ReportsTo:->]` - Traverse only ReportsTo-typed edges
- Returns nodes connected via those specific edges
- `(?department == "Engineering")` - Filter nodes by department attribute

Combines edge type filtering (structural query) with node attribute filtering (property query). This dual-level filtering is a hallmark of Jac's spatial model.

**Assign Comprehension on Edge Results**

Lines 129-130 demonstrate spatial bulk updates:
```
all_reports(=department="Updated");
```

Pattern:
1. Get nodes via edge traversal: `all_reports = [-->]`
2. Modify all retrieved nodes: `(=department="Updated")`

This enables graph-wide updates: traverse to find nodes, then update them in bulk. Common for propagating changes through graph structures.

**Chained Edge Traversal + Filter + Assign**

Lines 137-141 show the complete pattern:
```
targets = [-->];
high_earners = targets(?salary >= 75000);
high_earners(=salary=90000);
```

Three-step spatial operation:
1. **Traverse**: Get nodes via edges (`[-->]`)
2. **Filter**: Select subset matching criteria (`(?salary >= 75000)`)
3. **Modify**: Update selected nodes (`(=salary=90000)`)

This can be written as one expression:
```
[-->](?salary >= 75000)(=salary=90000);
```

This is the quintessential spatial programming pattern: navigate, filter, act.

**Empty Collection Handling**

Lines 177-180 show edge cases:
```
filtered_empty = empty(?x > 5);    # Returns: []
assigned_empty = empty(=x=10);     # Returns: []
```

Both comprehensions handle empty collections gracefully:
- Filter on empty returns empty
- Assign on empty returns empty
- No errors or exceptions

**Return Value Semantics**

Lines 184-190 clarify return values:

**Filter comprehension**:
- Returns NEW collection containing matching objects
- Original collection unchanged
- Returned collection is a subset

**Assign comprehension**:
- Returns SAME collection (modified in place)
- Original objects mutated
- Length unchanged

Example from lines 188-190:
```
filtered = original(?x > 0);   # New list, subset of original
assigned = original(=y=50);     # Same list, objects modified
```

After assign, `original[0].y` is 50 - the original objects were mutated.

**Comprehension Composition Patterns**

Based on the examples, comprehensions support these composition patterns:

1. **Filter → Filter**: `coll(?cond1)(?cond2)` - Sequential filtering
2. **Filter → Assign**: `coll(?cond)(=attr=val)` - Filter then modify
3. **Assign → Filter**: `coll(=attr=val)(?cond)` - Modify then filter (unusual)
4. **Edge → Filter**: `[-->](?cond)` - Spatial query
5. **Edge → Filter → Assign**: `[-->](?cond)(=attr=val)` - Full spatial update

**NULL_OK and TYPE_OP (Advanced)**

The grammar includes advanced filter features:

```
filter_compr: LPAREN NULL_OK filter_compare_list RPAREN
            | LPAREN TYPE_OP NULL_OK typed_filter_compare_list RPAREN
```

**NULL_OK** (`??`): Null-safe filtering
- Syntax: `collection(?? condition)`
- Handles null/None values gracefully
- Objects with None attributes don't cause exceptions

**TYPE_OP** (`\``): Typed filtering
- Syntax: `collection(\`Type ?? condition)`
- Filters by object type AND conditions
- Example: `nodes(\`Employee ?? salary > 50000)`

Note: These advanced features may not be demonstrated in this example but are part of the grammar.

**Comparison with Python Comprehensions**

Traditional Python list comprehension:
```python
filtered = [obj for obj in items if obj.x >= 10 and obj.y < 15]
```

Jac filter comprehension:
```jac
filtered = items(?x >= 10, y < 15);
```

Differences:
- Jac: Concise special syntax, no explicit iteration
- Jac: Direct attribute access (no `obj.` prefix needed)
- Jac: Multiple conditions comma-separated
- Jac: Integrates seamlessly with edge traversal results
- Python: More explicit, standard comprehension syntax

For assignment, Python requires explicit loop:
```python
for obj in objs:
    obj.y = 100
    obj.z = 200
```

Jac assign comprehension:
```jac
objs(=y=100, z=200);
```

Jac's assign comprehension is more concise for bulk updates.

**Spatial Programming Integration**

Special comprehensions are designed for Jac's spatial model:

1. **Edge traversal returns collections**: `[-->]`, `[->:Type:->]` return lists of nodes
2. **Comprehensions filter/modify collections**: `(?cond)`, `(=attr=val)`
3. **Natural composition**: `[edge_expr](?filter)(=assign)`

This creates a fluent API for graph queries:
```
visit [->:Friend:->](?age > 25, score > 80)(=notified=True);
```

Meaning: "Visit friends over age 25 with score over 80, mark them as notified"

**Use Cases**

**Filter comprehensions**:
- Finding specific nodes in graph traversal: `[-->](?dept=="Engineering")`
- Implementing graph queries: "find all X connected to Y where Z"
- Selecting subsets for processing: `candidates(?score > threshold)`
- Filtering walker targets: `visit [-->](?active==True);`

**Assign comprehensions**:
- Bulk state updates: `affected_nodes(=processed=True)`
- Initialization: `new_nodes(=status="pending", priority=0)`
- Propagating changes: `downstream(?changed==True)(=needs_update=True)`
- Resetting attributes: `session_nodes(=active=False)`

**Chained comprehensions**:
- Selective updates: `nodes(?condition)(=attr=new_val)`
- Multi-stage filtering: `candidates(?stage1)(?stage2)(?stage3)`
- Spatial queries: `[edge](?filter1)(?filter2)(=modify)`

**Performance Considerations**

- Filter comprehensions create new collections (allocation cost)
- Assign comprehensions mutate in-place (no allocation)
- Each chained comprehension iterates the collection
- For large collections, minimize chaining: `coll(?a, b, c)` better than `coll(?a)(?b)(?c)`
- Edge traversal + filter is optimized in runtime for spatial queries

**Grammar Coverage Summary**

This example demonstrates:
- ✅ Basic filter comprehension: `collection(?conditions...)`
- ✅ Basic assign comprehension: `collection(=attr=val...)`
- ✅ Multiple conditions in filters (AND logic)
- ✅ All comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- ✅ Chained filters: `coll(?a)(?b)`
- ✅ Chained filter+assign: `coll(?cond)(=attr=val)`
- ✅ Comprehensions on edge traversal results (critical OSP use case)
- ✅ Empty collection handling
- ⚠️ NULL_OK (`??`) - in grammar but not demonstrated
- ⚠️ TYPE_OP (`\`Type`) - in grammar but not demonstrated

Special comprehensions provide declarative, concise syntax for the filter-map-reduce operations common in spatial programming, making Jac particularly expressive for graph-based computation.
