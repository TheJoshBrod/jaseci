The `del` statement removes bindings, deletes collection elements, or removes object attributes, providing explicit memory management and data structure modification.

**Deleting List Elements**

Lines 5-8 demonstrate deleting a list element by index:
- `x = [2, 4, 5, 7, 9]` creates a list
- `del x[3]` removes the element at index 3 (the value 7)
- Remaining list is `[2, 4, 5, 9]`
- Subsequent elements shift down to fill the gap

**Deleting Variables**

Lines 11-14 show variable deletion:
- `y = 100` creates a binding
- `del y` removes the binding completely
- Attempting to access `y` afterward raises a `NameError`
- The variable name no longer exists in the scope

**Deleting Dictionary Items**

Lines 17-20 demonstrate dictionary item deletion:
- `d = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}` creates a dictionary
- `del d["b"]` removes the key-value pair with key "b"
- Resulting dictionary is `{"a": 1, "c": 3}`
- Attempting to delete a non-existent key raises a `KeyError`

**Deleting Object Attributes**

Lines 23-30 show attribute deletion:
- `MyClass` object has a `value` attribute
- `del instance.value` removes the attribute from the instance
- Accessing `instance.value` afterward raises an `AttributeError`
- The attribute is removed from the object's attribute dictionary

**Multiple Deletions**

Lines 33-36 demonstrate sequential deletions:
- `del lst[1]` deletes element at index 1
- After first deletion, indices shift
- `del lst[2]` deletes what is now at index 2 (originally index 3)
- Final list has two elements removed

Note: Deleting multiple indices requires care since each deletion shifts subsequent indices.

**Deleting Slices**

Lines 39-41 show slice deletion:
- `del numbers[2:5]` removes elements at indices 2, 3, and 4
- Slice syntax `[start:stop]` removes the range [start, stop)
- Remaining elements shift to fill the gap
- Original `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` becomes `[0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

**Del Statement Semantics**

The `del` keyword has different behavior depending on the target:

| Target Type | Effect | Error if Missing |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Variable | Remove binding from scope | NameError |
| List element | Remove and shift elements | IndexError |
| List slice | Remove range and shift | No error if empty |
| Dict key | Remove key-value pair | KeyError |
| Object attribute | Remove attribute | AttributeError |

**Memory Management**

When `del` removes the last reference to an object, Python's garbage collector can reclaim the memory. However, `del` doesn't directly free memory - it removes references. The object is freed when its reference count reaches zero.

**Use Cases**

Common uses for `del`:
- Removing unwanted collection elements
- Freeing memory by removing large data structure references
- Cleaning up temporary variables
- Removing computed attributes from objects
- Managing namespace pollution in long functions
