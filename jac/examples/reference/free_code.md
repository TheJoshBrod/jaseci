Free code refers to top-level executable code blocks in Jac modules, particularly those using the `with entry` construct, which allows code to run when the module is loaded or executed.

**Module Structure**

Lines 3-17 demonstrate typical module organization:
- Line 3: Import statement
- Lines 5-13: Object definition (circle)
- Lines 15-17: Function definition (foo)
- Lines 20-24: Free code block with entry

This structure separates definitions from executable code.

**Object Definition**

Lines 5-13 define a circle object with two methods:
- `init` (lines 6-8): Constructor that initializes the radius
- `area` (lines 10-12): Computes area using `math.pi`

Note that the object uses `self.radius` even though radius isn't declared with `has`. It's set dynamically in `init`.

**Function Definition**

Lines 15-17 define a standalone function `foo` that squares its input: `return n_1 ** 2`.

**Free Code with Entry Block**

Lines 20-24 demonstrate the `with entry` block, which is free code that executes when the module runs:

Line 21: `print("Hello World!")` - Executes unconditionally

Line 22: `print(foo(7))` - Calls the foo function with 7, printing 49

Line 23: `print(int(circle(10).area()))` - Demonstrates:
1. `circle(10)` - Creates a circle with radius 10
2. `.area()` - Calls the area method
3. `int(...)` - Converts the float result to int
4. `print(...)` - Outputs the value (approximately 314)

**Entry Block Semantics**

The `with entry` block:
- Executes when the module is loaded/run
- Has access to all module-level definitions
- Can perform initialization, setup, or main program logic
- Can be conditional (e.g., `with entry:__main__` only runs if module is the entry point)

**Free Code vs Entry Points**

| Concept | Placement | When Executes |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Free code | Outside any function/class | At module load time |
| `with entry` | Module level | At module load/execution |
| `with entry:__main__` | Module level | Only when module is main program |
| Regular code | Inside functions | When function is called |

**Use Cases**

Free code blocks are useful for:
- Main program logic in executable scripts
- Module initialization
- Running tests or examples
- Setting up module-level state
- Demonstrating API usage

The example demonstrates a complete mini-program: defining reusable components (circle object, foo function) and then using them in the entry block to produce output.
