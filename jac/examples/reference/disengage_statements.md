The `disengage` statement is a Jac-specific control flow mechanism that immediately stops walker execution and returns control to the caller, used primarily in walker-node interactions within graph traversal.

**Basic Disengage Semantics**

Line 15 shows the `disengage` keyword within a node's entry ability. When executed, `disengage` immediately terminates the walker's execution path and returns to the spawn point.

**Walker Definition**

Lines 3-9 define the Visitor walker with an entry ability that triggers on root nodes. The walker attempts to visit all outgoing edges `[-->]`, and if there are no edges, visits the root.

**Node with Disengage**

Lines 11-17 define an `item` node with a `speak` ability that triggers when the Visitor walker enters. The ability:
1. Prints "Hey There!!!"
2. Executes `disengage`
3. Immediately stops walker execution

**Graph Building and Execution**

Lines 21-25 demonstrate the disengage pattern:
- Lines 21-23 create 5 item nodes connected to root
- Line 25 spawns the Visitor walker on root
- Walker visits the first connected node
- Node's `speak` ability executes and calls `disengage`
- Walker stops immediately, never visiting the remaining 4 nodes

**Disengage vs Return vs Break**

Key differences:

| Statement | Scope | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `return` | Functions/methods | Exits function, returns value |
| `break` | Loops | Exits innermost loop |
| `disengage` | Walker abilities | Stops entire walker execution |
| `skip` | Walker abilities | Skips current node, continues traversal |

**Use Cases**

Common scenarios for `disengage`:
- Early termination when a search goal is found
- Stopping traversal upon error conditions
- Implementing walker-based search algorithms
- Conditional graph exploration (explore until condition met)

**Walker Execution Model**

When a walker is spawned, it:
1. Begins execution at the spawn point
2. Triggers entry abilities on encountered nodes
3. Continues traversing based on visit statements
4. Stops when: `disengage` is called, no more nodes to visit, or an exception occurs

Disengage provides explicit control over when to terminate walker execution, making it a key tool for implementing graph algorithms in Jac's data spatial programming model.
