**Implementation Blocks in Jac**

Implementation blocks (`impl`) provide bodies for forward-declared elements, separating interface declarations from their implementations. This pattern enables modular code organization and resolves circular dependencies.

**Forward Declarations**

Lines 4-6 show forward declarations using semicolons to declare signatures without bodies:

```
def compute(x: int, y: int) -> int;
obj Vehicle;
enum Priority;
```

Line 4: Function signature without implementation
Line 5: Object declaration without members
Line 6: Enum declaration without values

Forward declarations establish names and interfaces early, allowing references before full implementation.

**Function Implementation**

Lines 9-11 implement the forward-declared function:

```
impl compute(x: int, y: int) -> int {
    return x + y;
}
```

The `impl` keyword introduces the implementation block. The signature must match the forward declaration exactly.

**Object Implementation**

Lines 14-18 implement the forward-declared object:

```
impl Vehicle {
    has name: str = "Car";
    has speed: int = 0;
    def accelerate { self.speed += 10; }
}
```

The implementation adds the object's structure: member variables and methods.

**Enum Implementation**

Lines 21-25 implement the forward-declared enum:

```
impl Priority {
    LOW = 1,
    MEDIUM = 2,
    HIGH = 3
}
```

Enum implementations provide member names and their associated values.

**Using Implemented Elements**

Lines 27-35 demonstrate using the implemented elements:

```
with entry {
    result = compute(5, 3);      # Uses implemented function
    v = Vehicle();               # Creates instance of implemented object
    v.accelerate();              # Calls method from implementation
    p = Priority.HIGH;           # Uses enum member

    print(result, v.name, v.speed, p.value);
}
```

All elements work normally after implementation, as if they were defined in a single step.

**Forward Declaration and Implementation Pattern**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Code Organization]) --> Forward[Forward Declarations<br/>Signatures Only]
    Forward --> Refs[Can Reference<br/>in Other Code]
    Refs --> Impl[Implementation Blocks<br/>impl keyword]
    Impl --> Full[Fully Defined<br/>Elements]
    Full --> Use[Use in Code]
```

**Use Cases**

| Use Case | Benefit | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Circular dependencies | Break dependency cycles | Two objects referencing each other |
| Interface/Implementation separation | Clear API boundaries | Public signatures, private implementations |
| Large codebases | Organize related code | Headers and implementations in different sections |
| Code generation | Stable interfaces | Generated signatures, manual implementations |

**Declaration vs Implementation Comparison**

| Aspect | Forward Declaration | Implementation Block |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Keyword | `def`, `obj`, `enum` | `impl` |
| Ends with | Semicolon (`;`) | Block (`{ }`) |
| Contains | Signature only | Full definition |
| Purpose | Establish interface | Provide functionality |
| Location | Typically at top | Later in file or separate file |

**Implementation Flow Example**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    FD1[def compute;] --> Ref[Code can reference compute]
    FD2[obj Vehicle;] --> Ref
    FD3[enum Priority;] --> Ref
    Ref --> I1[impl compute { body }]
    Ref --> I2[impl Vehicle { members }]
    Ref --> I3[impl Priority { values }]
    I1 --> Ready[All Elements Ready]
    I2 --> Ready
    I3 --> Ready
```

**Common Patterns**

**Separating interface from implementation:**
```
# Forward declarations (interface)
def process_data(data: list) -> dict;
def validate_input(input: str) -> bool;

# Later in file or separate module
impl process_data(data: list) -> dict {
    # Implementation details
    return {"result": data};
}

impl validate_input(input: str) -> bool {
    return len(input) > 0;
}
```

**Resolving circular dependencies:**
```
# Forward declarations
obj NodeA;
obj NodeB;

# Implementations can reference each other
impl NodeA {
    has neighbor: NodeB;
}

impl NodeB {
    has neighbor: NodeA;
}
```

**Organizing complex types:**
```
# Declare all types first
enum Status;
obj Request;
obj Response;

# Implement later, in any order
impl Status {
    PENDING = 1,
    COMPLETE = 2
}

impl Request {
    has status: Status;
}

impl Response {
    has request: Request;
}
```

**Key Points**

1. Forward declarations establish names without full definitions
2. Implementation blocks provide the actual functionality
3. Signatures must match exactly between declaration and implementation
4. Useful for circular dependencies and code organization
5. Similar to header/source separation in C/C++
6. Elements can be referenced after forward declaration, before implementation
7. All types (functions, objects, enums) support this pattern
