Assert statements in Jac provide a unified mechanism for both debugging/validation and testing by allowing developers to verify that certain conditions hold true during program execution. The behavior of assert statements differs depending on the context: in regular code they raise `AssertionError` exceptions, while within test blocks they integrate with Jac's testing framework.

**Basic Assert Syntax**

The basic syntax for an assert statement is:
```jac
assert condition;
```

This will evaluate the condition. In regular code, if the condition is false or falsy, an `AssertionError` will be raised. Within test blocks, a failed assertion reports a test failure.

**Assert with Custom Message**

Jac also supports assert statements with custom error messages:
```jac
assert condition, "Custom error message";
```

When the assertion fails, the custom message will be included in the `AssertionError` (in regular code) or the test failure report (in test blocks), making debugging easier by providing context about what went wrong.

**Behavior in Regular Code**

In regular code, assert statements generate `AssertionError` exceptions when they fail, which can be caught using try-except blocks. This allows for graceful handling of assertion failures in production code or specific scenarios.

**Integration with Test Blocks**

Assert statements are commonly used within `test` blocks, which are Jac's language-level construct for organizing and running tests:

```jac
test test_name {
    assert condition1;
    assert condition2, "Condition 2 should be true";
    # more assertions...
}
```

Within test blocks, assert statements behave as test checks, integrating with the testing framework to report failures without raising exceptions that halt execution.

**Types of Assertions in Tests**

Assert statements in test blocks can verify various types of conditions:

**Equality and Comparison Checks**
- `assert a == b;` - Verifies two values are equal
- `assert a != b;` - Verifies two values are not equal  
- `assert a > b;` - Verifies comparison relationships

**Function Result Checks**
- `assert almostEqual(a, 6);` - Verifies function returns truthy value
- `assert someFunction();` - Verifies function execution succeeds

**Membership and Containment Checks**
- `assert "d" in "abc";` - Verifies membership relationships
- `assert item in collection;` - Verifies containment

**Expression Evaluation Checks**
- `assert a - b == 3;` - Verifies complex expressions evaluate correctly

**Use Cases**

Assert statements are commonly used for:

- **Input validation**: Checking that function parameters meet expected conditions (in regular code)
- **Testing**: Verifying that code produces expected results (in test blocks)
- **Debugging**: Ensuring that program state is as expected at specific points
- **Documentation**: Expressing assumptions about program behavior

**Testing Benefits**

The integration of assert statements directly into test blocks provides several advantages:

- **Language-level support**: Testing is a first-class citizen in Jac
- **Simplified syntax**: No need to import testing frameworks
- **Clear semantics**: The `assert` keyword makes intentions explicit
- **Integrated reporting**: Failed assertions in test blocks are automatically reported by the language runtime
- **Unified syntax**: Same construct works for both testing and validation

**Example: Regular Code Usage**

The function `foo` demonstrates assert usage in regular code, where the assertion checks that the input parameter `value` must be positive. When called with a negative value (-5), the assertion fails and raises an `AssertionError` with the message "Value must be positive", which is then caught and handled in a try-except block.

**Example: Test Block Usage**

```jac
test test_arithmetic {
    assert 2 + 2 == 4;
    assert 10 - 3 == 7;
    assert 5 * 5 == 25, "Multiplication should work correctly";
}
```

Assert statements make testing and validation an integral part of Jac development, encouraging developers to write tests and validations as they build their applications, ensuring code correctness through built-in verification mechanisms.
