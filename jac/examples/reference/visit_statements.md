Visit statements are a core feature of Jac's spatial programming model, controlling how walkers traverse graph structures by specifying which nodes to visit next. They embody the fundamental paradigm shift in Object-Spatial Programming from "data flows to computation" to "computation flows to data"â€”instead of data being passed to stationary functions, walkers (autonomous computational entities) move through the data space (nodes and edges), processing information contextually based on their current location.

**Basic Visit with Edge Expression**

Line 19 demonstrates the simplest visit statement: `visit [-->];`. This tells the walker to traverse all outgoing edges from the current node. The `[-->]` is an edge expression that selects all edges going out from the current node. When this executes, the walker will visit each node connected by these edges.

**Visit with Else Clause**

Lines 6-9 show a visit statement with an else clause: `visit [-->] else { ... }`. The else clause executes when there are no edges to visit (when the edge expression matches no edges).

In this example:
- If `[-->]` finds outgoing edges, the walker visits those nodes
- If `[-->]` finds no edges (dead end), the else block executes
- Lines 7-8 visit the root node and then disengage (stop the walker)

This pattern is useful for handling terminal nodes or implementing backtracking behavior.

**Visit with Direct Node Reference**

Lines 7 and 28 show visiting a specific node: `visit root;`. Instead of an edge expression, you can directly specify a node to visit. This is useful for:
- Jumping to specific nodes
- Returning to a known location (like root)
- Implementing custom traversal patterns

**Typed Visit Expression (Commented)**

Line 16 shows a commented-out typed visit: `visit :node: [-->];`. The `:node:` syntax would filter the traversal to only visit nodes of a specific type. This allows walkers to selectively visit nodes based on their type, though this example indicates it may not be currently active.

**Conditional Visit**

Lines 31-34 demonstrate conditional visiting based on walker state. The visit only occurs if `self.count < 5`:
```
if self.count < 5 {
    visit [-->];
    self.count += 1;
}
```

This pattern enables:
- Limiting traversal depth
- Conditional exploration based on walker state
- Implementing search algorithms with termination conditions

**Edge Expressions**

Edge expressions specify which edges to follow:

| Expression | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `[-->]` | All outgoing edges |
| `[<--]` | All incoming edges |
| `[<-->]` | All edges (both directions) |

These can be combined with type filters and conditions for sophisticated traversal control.

**Walker Definition and Abilities**

Lines 3-11 define a walker with an ability that uses visit statements. The `can travel with \`root entry` syntax means this ability executes when the walker enters a root node. The visit statements within control how the walker continues its traversal.

Lines 13-21 define another walker showing the straightforward visit without else clause.

Lines 23-36 define a walker with state (`count`) that uses conditional visiting to control traversal behavior.

**Node Abilities**

Lines 38-50 define nodes with abilities that execute when walkers visit them. Line 39 shows `can speak with Visitor entry`, meaning this ability triggers when a `Visitor` walker enters an `item` node. These abilities can contain their own logic but don't control the walker's traversal - that's handled by visit statements in the walker.

**Graph Setup**

Lines 54-56 build a graph structure by creating 5 `item` nodes connected to root. Line 59 spawns the `Visitor` walker, which will traverse this graph according to its visit statements.

**Visit Statement Semantics**

When a visit statement executes:
1. The edge expression is evaluated to find matching edges
2. For each matching edge, the walker queues a visit to the target node
3. Node entry abilities execute as nodes are visited
4. The walker continues until no more visits are queued or it disengages

**Traversal Control**

Visit statements work with other control statements:
- `disengage` (line 8): stops the walker immediately
- `if` conditions: control whether visits occur
- `else` clauses: handle cases where no edges match

**Multiple Visits**

A walker can have multiple visit statements in sequence, each potentially visiting different sets of nodes. The walker maintains a queue of pending visits and processes them according to the traversal strategy (depth-first or breadth-first, determined by the spawn operator).
