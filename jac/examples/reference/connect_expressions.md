Connect expressions in Jac provide specialized syntax for creating and traversing graph structures by connecting nodes with edges. These operators are fundamental to Jac's data spatial programming model.

**Node and Edge Definitions**

Lines 3-5 define a node archetype `node_a` with an integer value. Lines 12-14 define an edge archetype `MyEdge` with a value attribute initialized to 5. Nodes and edges are the building blocks of Jac graphs.

**Basic Connect Operator (++>)**

Line 21 demonstrates the simple connection operator: `end ++> (end := node_a(value=i))`. This creates a directed edge from `end` to a newly created node, then assigns that new node back to `end`.

The `++>` operator:
- Creates an edge from the left operand (source node) to the right operand (target node)
- Uses the default edge type
- Returns the target node

**Typed Connect Operator (+>:Type:attr=val:+>)**

Line 24 shows the typed connection syntax: `end +>:MyEdge:val=i:+> (end := node_a(value=i + 10))`.

This advanced syntax allows:
- Specifying the edge type (`:MyEdge:`)
- Setting edge attributes (`:val=i:`)
- Creating a connection with custom edge properties

The format is: `source +>:EdgeType:attribute=value:+> target`

**Edge Traversal with Filters**

Line 31 demonstrates filtered edge traversal: `for i in [->:MyEdge:val <= 6:->]`. This syntax:
- `[->:MyEdge:val <= 6:->]` - traverses edges of type MyEdge where val <= 6
- Returns the target nodes of matching edges
- Iterates over the results

The edge filter syntax is: `[->:EdgeType:condition:->]` for outgoing edges.

**Untyped Traversal**

Line 34 shows simple traversal: `visit [-->]`. The `[-->]` syntax traverses all outgoing edges regardless of type, visiting all connected nodes.

**Walker Entry Points**

Lines 7-10 define walker entry points using backtick syntax:
- `` `root entry `` - triggers on root node
- `` `root | node_a entry `` - triggers on root OR node_a

These specify which node types activate the walker's abilities.

**Graph Building Pattern**

Lines 18-26 show a common pattern:
1. Start with a reference node (`end`)
2. In a loop, create new nodes
3. Connect them using `++>` or typed connects
4. Update the reference to the newly created node
5. This builds a chain or tree structure

**Walker-Node Interaction**

Line 38 spawns a walker on the root: `root spawn Creator()`. The walker then executes its entry abilities, building and traversing the graph structure.

Connect expressions make Jac particularly powerful for graph-based algorithms, knowledge graphs, and data spatial computations.
