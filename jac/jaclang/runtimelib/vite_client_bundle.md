# Vite Client Bundle - Polyfill Removal

## Why We Removed the Object.prototype.get() Polyfill

### The Problem
The original `__jacEnsureObjectGetPolyfill()` function was adding a `.get()` method to `Object.prototype` to provide Python-style dictionary access (`obj.get("key", defaultValue)`). However, this caused a critical conflict with React components:

```
Uncaught TypeError: property descriptors must not specify a value or be writable when a getter or setter has been specified
```

### Root Cause
- **React components** (especially Ant Design components) create objects with getters/setters
- **The polyfill** was adding a `.get()` method with `writable: true` to `Object.prototype`
- **Property descriptor conflict**: You cannot have both a data property (`value` + `writable`) AND accessor properties (getters/setters) on the same object

### The Solution
Instead of trying to fix the polyfill, we **eliminated it entirely** by replacing all `.get()` calls with standard JavaScript object access:

```javascript
// Before (causing conflicts)
payload.get("function")
data.get("token", defaultValue)

// After (standard JavaScript)
payload["function"]
data["token"] || defaultValue
```

### Why We Don't Need the Polyfill
1. **Standard JavaScript is sufficient**: `obj["key"]` and `obj.key` work perfectly for object access
2. **No React conflicts**: Standard object access doesn't interfere with React's property descriptors
3. **Better performance**: No prototype modification overhead
4. **Cleaner code**: More idiomatic JavaScript patterns

### Benefits of Removal
- ✅ **No more property descriptor errors** with React components
- ✅ **Better compatibility** with modern JavaScript libraries
- ✅ **Cleaner runtime** without prototype pollution
- ✅ **Standard JavaScript patterns** that developers expect

The polyfill was a Python-to-JavaScript convenience that caused more problems than it solved. Standard JavaScript object access is the better approach for client-side React applications.
