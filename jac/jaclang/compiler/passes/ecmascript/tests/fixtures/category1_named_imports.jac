"""Category 1: Named Imports - Test fixture for import pattern validation.

This fixture tests the following patterns from the proposal:
1. Single named import: import { useState } from 'react'
2. Multiple named imports: import { a, b, c } from 'lib'
3. Named import with alias: import { foo as bar } from 'lib'
"""

cl {
# Single named import
import from react { useState }

# Multiple named imports
import from lodash { map, filter, reduce }

# Named import with alias
import from axios { get as httpGet }

# Mixed named imports and aliases
import from vue { createApp, ref as reactive, computed }

# Relative path imports
import from .utils { helper }
import from ..lib { formatter as format }

# Module prefix notation (jac:client_runtime)
import from jac:client_runtime {
    renderJsxTree,
    jacLogin,
